<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Terry Darnell Bolden Jr. I am the son of a Marine, which pretty much means I was raised to be able to
  adapt and multitask from an
  early age. I am currently a UX/UI designer with a focus of user experience. As of December 2024, I have began to learn
  to code in order to expand
  my skill set and be able to become a better designer and eventually, a more adept web develper. My current job, for
  the last three years is at a private company called Tigris Fulfillment Partners, where I work full time as a Warehouse
  Lead. My most refined skills at adaption and multitasking allow me to lead the Returns Department, as well as assist
  other departments when possible. I also own The Bolden Design Experience, a company that takes pride in helping people
  achieve their dream of small business ownership by building platforms for small business owners to showcase their
  business and help the world with whatever niche the small business owner has decided to partake. I do all of this to
  support my loving wife, my four daughters and my parents. It is my goal to help as many small business owners to not
  only recognize that they offer something unique to the world, but to help them showcase either the service or the
  physical product in which their business was founded. I believe, through creativity, drive, and resilience, any small
  business owner can build a successful business and flourish. Having the skills to adapt and multitask makes this an
  ideal field for me to engage in and I could not be more happy to continue to learn and become a better designer and
  web developer so that the goal of The Bolden Design Experience will be synonomous with refined, accessible platforms
  that prioritize the user experience.></a>

<p>I first became interested in tech way back in 1995, my freshman year of college and the timeframe right before the
  internet was born. Back then, we were only learning what the internet could become and I never followed through, due
  to poor life choices and decisions. I would put down my interest to support a family through various jobs in Service,
  Customer Service, and Retail. As I would take these jobs, I would learn the ins and out and the policies of the
  companies I would work for. Utilizing my skills of being able to adapt to any situation, and multitask different
  company goals, I would eventually work my way up from the ground floor to some form of management in every job I would
  take from the age of twenty to my current situation. Poor life choices and decisions aside, my work and my work ethic
  spoke for itself. It would usually only take me six months to a year to move up in a job and when I felt I had learned
  all that I could from one job, I would take those skills that I learned and refined and find a new opportunity to
  learn and grow. An unexpected medical situation would happen in 2022 that would forever change my outlook on the jobs
  I chased, the things I learned and where I wanted to be ultimately to finish my career.

<p>In 2022, I experienced what is known as a Gastrointestinal perforation. In lamens terms, I developped a hole in my
  stomach. Neither I, nor the doctors know what caused it to this day, but my ability to adapt allowed me to see that
  working in Retail is great as you get to learn so many things, (about customers, about fulfilling the needs and the
  desires of shareholders and business owners,) the physical toll that I was putting on my body would not allow me to do
  this line of work for more than a few more years. This would not be something I could retire from. So, I adapted and
  utilized my kink for learning to learn Ux and UI. So I enrolled in a bootcamp by the name of Merit America, spent
  weeks learning how to research, cater to and successfully solve problems in the world of web apps and web pages. As I
  learned more about the industry and the impact it has on everyday life, I dove in headfirst and became good at
  adapting to the ever changing landscape. I am confident in myself at being able to adapt to when things go wrong, how
  to diagnose and fix problems, and how to cater my decisions towards the success of my client(s). So to refine my
  skills and to alway sget better, I signed up for several workshops that would help me grow. Some of the workshops were
  for UX, some were for Website Accessibility, and some were for coding. As I enjoy learning about this industry and
  wanting to grow in it, I focused on my skills that I think are a big part of who I am. In the world of User
  Experience, where I want to specialize, you learn that many don't have the same experience with different things, but
  it is possible to provide an experience that limits those who would be excluded from the target market and make a user
  experience that would incorporate everyone and make life simpler for users. Adaptable-creative-multitasking-problem
  solver. That is who I have been my entire life, and now I found the career to go with it. </p>
